# Gene Information Extraction from Annotation Files

This script is designed to process gene annotation files, specifically GFF files, to extract unique gene names and generate detailed reports. It is organized into several clearly defined steps, each responsible for a distinct part of the gene extraction and reporting process.

## Overview

The script works by reading GFF or GFF3 files from a specified directory, extracting gene names using criteria defined in the script, and writing a report for each file that summarizes the unique genes identified. The steps below outline how to prepare for execution, define necessary functions, and run the script.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, ensure that the Python environment has the `os` module available, as it is essential for file and directory operations.

```python
import os
```

## 1. Extracting Gene Names

The first function `parse_gff_for_gene_names` is designed to parse GFF files to identify and collect unique gene names. It utilizes a set to prevent duplication of gene names.

### Function Code:

```py
def parse_gff_for_gene_names(file_path):
    gene_names = set()  # Use a set to avoid duplicates
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if line.startswith('#') or line.strip() == '':
                continue  # Skip header and empty lines
            parts = line.strip().split('\t')
            if len(parts) > 2 and parts[2] == 'CDS':
                attributes = parts[8]
                gene_name = None
                for attribute in attributes.split(';'):
                    if attribute.startswith('gene=') or attribute.startswith('Name='):
                        gene_name = attribute.split('=')[1]
                        break
                if gene_name:  # Only add if a gene name is found
                    gene_names.add(gene_name)
    return gene_names
```

## 2. Define Gene Report Function

The second function `generate_report_from_folder` iterates over all GFF files in a given directory, uses the `parse_gff_for_gene_names` function to extract gene names, and generates a text report summarizing these names.

### Function code:

```py
def generate_report_from_folder(input_folder_path, output_base_path):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(input_folder_path):
        relative_path = os.path.relpath(root, input_folder_path)
        output_path = os.path.join(output_base_path, relative_path)
        for file_name in files:
            if file_name.endswith('.gff') or file_name.endswith('.gff3'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file_name)
                gene_names = parse_gff_for_gene_names(file_path)
                reports_folder = os.path.join(output_path, 'gene_reports')
                os.makedirs(reports_folder, exist_ok=True)
                report_file_name = os.path.basename(file_path) + '_gene_report.txt'
                report_file_path = os.path.join(reports_folder, report_file_name)
                with open(report_file_path, 'w') as report_file:
                    report_file.write(f"File: {os.path.basename(file_path)}\n")
                    report_file.write(f"Total unique gene names: {len(gene_names)}\n")
                    report_file.write("Gene Names:\n")
                    for gene_name in sorted(gene_names):
                        report_file.write(gene_name + '\n')
                    report_file.write("-" * 40 + '\n')
                print(f"Report generated: {report_file_path}")
```

## 3. Specify Input Folder

Set the directory path where the GFF files are stored.

```py
input_folder_path = '/group/ecoli_acras/Data/Assemblies/campaign2'
```

## 4. Specify Output Folder for Reports

Set the base path where the gene reports will be saved.

```py
output_base_path = '/group/ecoli_acras/Jingbo/reference_annotation/campaign2'
```

## 5. Execute the Function

Run the function with the specified paths to generate the reports.

```py
generate_report_from_folder(input_folder_path, output_base_path)
```

## Output

After executing the script, reports will be generated in the specified output directory for each GFF file processed. Each report summarizes the unique gene names extracted from the respective GFF file.
