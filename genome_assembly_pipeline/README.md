# Pipeline Version Overview

This document outlines various configurations of a genomic analysis pipeline, detailing the processes involved in merging paired-end reads, assembling the merged reads, and annotating the assemblies. Each pipeline version uses different methods for these steps, tailored to specific research needs or data types.

## Pipeline 1

**Merging Overlapping Paired-End Reads**

**Annotating Assembly in Prokka Default Mode**

- **Merge**: Choice 1 - This step involves merging overlapping paired-end reads to improve the quality and contiguity of the assembly.
- **Assembly**: Choice 1 - The merged reads are then assembled into longer contiguous sequences.
- **Annotation**: Choice 1 - The assembled sequences are annotated using Prokka in its default mode, which is optimized for fast and accurate annotation of bacterial genomes.

## Pipeline 1.1

**Merging Overlapping Paired-End Reads**

**Annotating Assembly in Prokka Reference Genome Priority Mode**

- **Merge**: Choice 1 - Similar to Pipeline 1, overlapping paired-end reads are merged.
- **Assembly**: Choice 1 - The merged reads are assembled into contigs.
- **Annotation**: Choice 2 - In this version, the assembly is annotated with a priority given to aligning with a reference genome, providing more precise annotations based on known genomic information.

## Pipeline 2

**Merging Overlapping and Nonoverlapping Paired-End Reads**

**Annotating Assembly in Prokka Default Mode**

- **Merge**: Choice 2 - This approach not only merges reads that overlap but also attempts to join reads that do not naturally overlap by extending them artificially.
- **Assembly**: Choice 1 - Assembled as in the previous pipelines, focusing on creating contiguous sequences from the merged reads.
- **Annotation**: Choice 1 - The final sequences are annotated using the default settings of Prokka, suitable for a broad range of bacterial genomes.

## Pipeline 2.1

**Merging Overlapping and Nonoverlapping Paired-End Reads**

**Annotating Assembly in Prokka Reference Genome Priority Mode**

- **Merge**: Choice 2 - Combines both overlapping and nonoverlapping paired-end reads, enhancing the potential for a more comprehensive assembly.
- **Assembly**: Choice 1 - Assembles the reads into contigs.
- **Annotation**: Choice 2 - Uses a reference genome as a template to prioritize the annotation process, aiming for annotations that are consistent with well-characterized genomes.

Each pipeline version is designed to accommodate different types of sequence data and annotation requirements, allowing users to choose the most suitable approach based on their specific needs and the nature of their genomic data.
