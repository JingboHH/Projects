# Gene Presence-Absence Matrix Generation

## Overview

This script is designed to analyze the presence or absence of genes across multiple samples. It reads gene lists from text files, compares these lists to a reference gene set, and constructs a matrix indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each gene in each sample.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Libraries: `os`, `pandas`

## Functions

### read_genes

This function reads a text file containing gene names, returning a list of genes.

**Arguments:**
- `filename`: The path to the file containing gene names.

**Returns:**
- A list of gene names.

### create_gene_matrix

Generates a matrix indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of reference genes in multiple sample files.

**Arguments:**
- `reference_file`: Path to the text file containing the reference genes.
- `sample_folder`: Directory containing sample files with gene lists.

**Returns:**
- A `pandas.DataFrame` object representing the presence-absence matrix.

**Details:**
1. Reads the reference genes using `read_genes`.
2. Lists all sample files in the specified folder, filtering for files with a `.txt` extension.
3. Initializes a DataFrame with reference genes as rows and sample files as columns, defaulting all values to 0.
4. Updates the DataFrame by setting a 1 for each gene present in a sample.

## Usage

First, specify the paths to the reference genome file and the directory containing the sample files:

```python
reference_file = '/Users/jingbohe/GAPE/reference_genome.txt'
sample_folder = '/Users/jingbohe/GAPE/pipelines/pipeline2'
```

Then, generate the gene presence-absence matrix and save it to a CSV file:

```python
gene_matrix = create_gene_matrix(reference_file, sample_folder)
gene_matrix.to_csv('/Users/jingbohe/GAPE/pipelines/pipeline2/output_matrix1.csv')
print("Matrix saved to 'output_matrix1.csv'")
```

## Output

The script will output a CSV file named output_matrix1.csv in the specified directory. This file contains the gene presence-absence matrix, where rows represent genes and columns represent sample files.
