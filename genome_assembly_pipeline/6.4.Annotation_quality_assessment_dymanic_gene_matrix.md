# Dynamic Gene Presence-Absence Matrix Generation

## Overview

This script dynamically constructs a presence-absence matrix for gene data across multiple samples. It reads genes listed in text files, skips header lines, and updates a matrix to indicate whether each gene is present in each sample.

## Dependencies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and to maintain the matrix.

## Functions

### read_genes

This function opens a text file to read gene names, ignoring the first three lines which might contain headers or metadata. It ensures that each gene name is cleaned of extra spaces.

**Arguments:**
- `filename`: Path to the file containing gene names.

**Returns:**
- A list of gene names, stripped of any surrounding whitespace.

**Code Explanation:**
- `open(filename, 'r')`: Opens the file in read mode.
- `file.readlines()[3:]`: Reads all lines from the file, skipping the first three.
- `[gene.strip() for gene in genes]`: Cleans up each gene name by stripping whitespace.

### update_gene_matrix

Updates the gene matrix to reflect the presence or absence of genes listed in the `new_genes` list for the given `sample_name`. It ensures that every new gene is added to the matrix and marks its presence for the specified sample.

**Arguments:**
- `matrix`: DataFrame representing the current gene matrix.
- `new_genes`: List of genes from a new sample to update in the matrix.
- `sample_name`: Name of the sample to update in the matrix.

**Returns:**
- The updated DataFrame.

**Code Explanation:**
- `if sample_name not in matrix.columns`: Checks if the sample column already exists in the matrix.
- `matrix[sample_name] = 0`: Initializes a new column for the sample with all genes set to 0.
- `for gene in new_genes`: Iterates over each gene in the new sample.
- `if gene not in matrix.index`: Adds new genes to the matrix if they don't already exist.
- `matrix.at[gene, sample_name] = 1`: Sets the matrix cell value to 1 to indicate the presence of the gene.

### process_samples

Processes each sample file in the specified directory, updating the gene matrix for each file. It is designed to handle multiple samples and dynamically update the matrix as new samples are added.

**Arguments:**
- `sample_folder`: Directory containing sample files.

**Returns:**
- A fully updated gene matrix with all samples processed.

**Code Explanation:**
- `gene_matrix = pd.DataFrame()`: Initializes an empty DataFrame for the gene matrix.
- `[os.path.join(sample_folder, f) for f in os.listdir(sample_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]`: Generates a list of all text files in the directory.
- `for file in sample_files`: Iterates through each sample file.
- `genes = read_genes(file)`: Reads genes from the file.
- `update_gene_matrix(...)`: Updates the gene matrix with genes from the current sample.

## Usage

Specify the directory containing the sample gene files, and run the script to generate the gene presence-absence matrix. Optionally, save the matrix to a CSV file.

```python
# Specify the directory path containing the gene files
sample_folder = '/Users/jingbohe/GAPE/genes_1'
gene_matrix = process_samples(sample_folder)

# Optionally save the matrix to a CSV file, filling any missing values with 0
gene_matrix.fillna(0, inplace=True)
gene_matrix.to_csv('/Users/jingbohe/GAPE/genes_1/dynamic_matrix.csv')
print("Matrix saved to 'dynamic_matrix.csv'")
```
